# Basic-Programing-EX01

# Goals:
  Development of a dot net application with the help of Visual Studio.  
  Practice writing a program in C# syntax.
  Work with I/O in the Console environment.
  Familiarity with classes: string, int, float, char, math, StringBuilder.
  
# Ex01_01 - Binary sequences
  Write a program that receives three positive integers from the user, each containing 9 digits.
  The program will convert the bianary numbers to decimals and will print the output in ascending order.
  Additionally the program will print statistics about the input:
    1. What is the average of zeros/ones in each input number?
    2. How many input numbers are powers of two?
    3. How many of the input numbers their decimal digits are in ascending order?
    4. Which number is the largest and which is the smallest?
      
# Ex01_02 - Diamond for begginers
  Write a program that prints a rhombus of asterisks as shown bellow:
...
//      *
//     ***
//    *****
//   *******
//  *********
//   *******
//    *****
//     ***
//      *
...
# Ex01_03 - Diamond for advanced
  Write a program that will work as the previous task (diamond for begginers) but instead it will get the height of the rhombus from the user input.
  User the previous task assembly as reference.
  
# Ex01_04 - String parsing
  Write a program that gets a string input of length 8 and prints the following details:
    1. Is the input string is a polindrom (using recursion)?
    2. If the input string is a number, is it divisible by five without a remainder?
    3. If the input string is an english letters string, how many small letters it has?
    
# Ex01_05 - Numbers statistics
  Write a program that gets as input a positive nine digits number and prints the following details:
    1. What is the largest digit in the number?
    2. What is the smallest digit in the number?
    3. How many digits are divisible by four without a remainder?
    4. How many digits are greater than the unit digit?
